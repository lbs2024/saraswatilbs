<h2> LBS English Medium School</h2>
<h3>CBSE Affiliated</h3>
<p><b><i>LBS School is from Nursery to Grade XII. The students of our school are in an age-group that we consider as highly sensitive and impressionable. It is the age where the roots are being formed and the most appropriate time to sow the seeds of confidence and good character. Our goal is to be a leader in education, inspiring our children at the right age to become global citizens who will abide by highest values at all times.
